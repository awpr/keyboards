# Mitosis Keyboard

This configures the [Mitosis
Keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/66588f/wireless_split_qmk_mitosis/),
a wireless, miniature, split, ergonomic keyboard designed by /u/reverse\_bias.

Despite the unusual direct-wiring circuitry, wireless design, multi-controller
architecture, and custom matrix code, everything seems to work as expected,
including erasing EEPROM layouts with bootmagic-lite.
