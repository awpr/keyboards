# ErgoDox EZ

This configures the [ErgoDox EZ](https://www.ergodox-ez.com), a
commercially-built version of the open-source ErgoDox design, produced by
[ZSA](https://www.zsa.io).  It's likely to work with personal ErgoDox builds,
too, since the QMK firmware (and thus USB vendor/product ID) is the same for
both the commercial one and personal builds.
